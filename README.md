Introduction
Online hate speech poses serious social and psychological threats, often escalating tensions within communities.
Counterspeech—a positive, corrective response to hateful content—has been shown to help mitigate harm but is challenging to generate at scale. While many approaches produce generic replies, the need for intent-specific counterspeech (e.g., informative, denouncing, questioning, positive, humorous) is crucial for aligning responses with context and audience expectations.

Related Work
Research on hateful content has examined counterspeech generation from various angles. For example, efforts to collect richer data for multilingual counterspeech were described in a multi-target approach that leverages human-in-the-loop mechanisms . Additionally, the METEOR metric was introduced to improve correlation with human judgments in machine translation tasks, influencing how we might evaluate text generation . Recent developments in intent-conditioned counterspeech introduce novel architectures for learning separate representations of style and content; this helps achieve better performance and more precise control in responses .


A lexical reconstruction module that encourages token-level fidelity.
A style-conditional cross-encoder to maintain semantic coherence.
Incorporating external knowledge bases and reinforcement learning for style fidelity can further refine counterspeech generation.

How to Run the Code
Since the folder has only the baseline and novelty codes , just download both these files separately and run on Google Colab or any other local python environment.
